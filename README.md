# Feasibility of a New Business in a Second Hand Market Place.
In response to challenges faced by individuals in the secondhand marketplace, 
we aim to conduct a comprehensive analysis of the current market landscape, incorporating insights from surveys and situational assessments. 
The goal is to evaluate the feasibility of introducing a new platform that addresses the existing issues and enhances the overall experience for buying and selling in the secondhand marketplace. 
Through this exploration, we seek to identify opportunities for improvement and innovation, laying the foundation for a successful venture in the dynamic realm of secondhand commerce.

In the meticulous process of data collection, our analysis unfolds through a dual-pronged approach, incorporating both quantitative surveys and targeted web scraping.
The quantitative facet involves the execution of two surveys, meticulously crafted to garner insights into the dynamics of the secondhand marketplace. 
These surveys are designed to extract numerical data, providing a quantitative foundation for our analysis.
Simultaneously, we employ web scraping techniques to delve into the online landscape, extracting real-time information from diverse platforms. 
This dual-method strategy positions our analysis to offer a comprehensive understanding of the multifaceted secondhand marketplace and finally lead to a conclusion if a business could be established in this domain.
