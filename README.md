# Feasibility of a New Business in a Second Hand Market Place.
In response to challenges faced by individuals in the secondhand marketplace, 
we aim to conduct a comprehensive analysis of the current market landscape, incorporating insights from surveys and situational assessments. 
The goal is to evaluate the feasibility of introducing a new platform that addresses the existing issues and enhances the overall experience for buying and selling in the secondhand marketplace. 
Through this exploration, we seek to identify opportunities for improvement and innovation, laying the foundation for a successful venture in the dynamic realm of secondhand commerce.

In the meticulous process of data collection, our analysis unfolds through a dual-pronged approach, incorporating both quantitative surveys and targeted web scraping.
The quantitative facet involves the execution of two surveys, meticulously crafted to garner insights into the dynamics of the secondhand marketplace. 
These surveys are designed to extract numerical data, providing a quantitative foundation for our analysis.
Simultaneously, we employ web scraping techniques to delve into the online landscape, extracting real-time information from diverse platforms. 
This dual-method strategy positions our analysis to offer a comprehensive understanding of the multifaceted secondhand marketplace and finally lead to a conclusion if a business could be established in this domain.

# Data sources and Datasets:
Our data compilation involved three main sources:

1.	 Initially, we employed web scraping to gather data specifically related to furniture items from Craigslist. Since, there is no readymade dataset available, web scraping was opted to extract: Title, Price, Location, URL, Date posted.

2.	Subsequently, we conducted a comprehensive review collection from popular second-hand marketplace apps. The reviews could not be scraped as the site had too many apps and no specific format for reviews posted by different profiles hence web scraping code was not an efficient method. Hence, we opted for manual web scraping and categorized them into a set of 7 different scam types.

3.	 Finally, we acquired primary data through a survey, covering various attributes such as pickup modes, issues on WhatsApp, types of scams, preferred apps, and more. We surveyed over 80 people from Curry center, Snell library and from random people on campus.
